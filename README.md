# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Louise is a play writer who has a play called Fever and she wants to start a crowd funding campaing to help fund the play. In planning the funding of her play she wanted to review how different campaigns performed depending on their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in predicting the success of her fundraising goal will look like depending on when is the launch date. This includes comparing other campaigns that have been successful or failed in the past years by reviewing the relation of their lauch date and their funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
To carry out the analysis, I used the Kickstarter worksheet to go over the outcomes by launch dates and based on the goals of campaigns that were in theater category and plays as subcategory. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the outcomes based on the launch dates, I gathered the campaigns in the theater category from 2009 ot 2017 (8 years) to go over which ones were successfull, failed or were canceled depending on the month of the year their launch date was. I created a pivot table to better analyze the amount of campaigns that were either successful, failed or canceled in each month. 

Therefor, I noticed the following: 
- The highest amount of successful theater campaigns were during the months of May to July and it is also when the most campaigns have lauching dates in the year.
- In the month of December there are the highest number of failed campaigns and when the least campaigns have launch dates. 
- The amount of canceled campaigns is higherst in the month of January.

This information is demostrated with the line chart below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the outcomes base on goals, I analysed the campaign goals depending on the range of the goal starting from less than $1000 to more than $50000, then depending on those ranges the number of campaings successful, failed or canceled reaching their goal and filtering by "Plays" as the subcategory. 

Additionally, from the number of campaings successful, failed or canceled reaching their goal we will get the percentage compared to the total number of projects for each range.

For this analysis I notice the following: 
- There are higher number of total projects (play campaigns) with a lower goal amount and also higher percentage of campaigns being successful. 
- After $24999 or higher goal amount the total projects lower and the percentage of campaigns failed to reach their goal increases. 
- Also that there are zero canceled campaigns in this subcategory. 

This information is demostrated with the line chart below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
