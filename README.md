# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Louise is a play writer who has a play called Fever and she wants to start a crowd funding campaing to help fund the play. In planning the funding of her play she wanted to review how different campaigns performed depending on their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in predicting the success of her fundraising goal will look like depending on when is the launch date. This includes comparing other campaigns that have been successful or failed in the past years by reviewing the relation of their lauch date and their funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
To carry out the analysis, I used the Kickstarter worksheet to go over the outcomes by launch dates and based on the goals of campaigns that were in theater category and plays as subcategory. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the outcomes based on the launch dates, I gathered the campaigns in the theater category from 2009 ot 2017 (8 years) to go over which ones were successfull, failed or were canceled depending on the month of the year their launch date was. I created a pivot table to better analyze the amount of campaigns that were either successful, failed or canceled in each month. 

Therefor, I noticed that highest amount of successful theater campaigns were during the months of May to July which I can demostrate the information with the line chart below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
