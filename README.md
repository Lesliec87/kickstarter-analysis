# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Louise is a play writer who has a play called Fever and she wants to start a crowd funding campaing to help fund her play. In planning the funding of her play she wanted to review how different campaigns performed depending on their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Louise in predicting what the success of her fundraising goal will look like depending on when is the launch date. This includes comparing the data of other campaigns that have been successful or failed in the past years.

## Analysis and Challenges
To carry out the analysis, I used the Kickstarter worksheet to go over campaigns that were in the "theater" category for the outcomes by launch date. I also reviewed productons campaigns that were subcategorized as "plays" and based on the goals of campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the outcomes based on the launch dates, I gathered the campaigns in the theater category from 2009 to 2017 (8 years) to go over which ones were successfull, failed or were canceled depending on the month their launch date was. I created a pivot table to better analyze the amount of campaigns that were either successful, failed or canceled in each month. 

Therefor, I noticed the following: 
- The highest amount of successful theater campaigns were during the months of May to July and it is also when the most campaigns have lauching dates in the year.
- In the month of December there are the highest number of failed campaigns and when the least campaigns have launch dates. 
- The amount of canceled campaigns is highest in the month of January.

This information is demostrated with the line chart below:

### #Analysis-of-Outcomes-Based-on-Goals
From the outcomes base on goals, I analysed the campaign goals depending on the range of the goal starting from less than $1000 to more than $50000, then depending on those ranges the number of campaings that were successful, failed or canceled in reaching their goal and filtering by "Plays" as the subcategory. 

Additionally, from the number of campaings that were successful, failed or canceled reaching their goal we will get the percentage compared to the total number of projects for each range.

For this analysis I notice the following: 
- There are higher number of total projects (play campaigns) with a lower goal amount and also higher percentage of campaigns being successful. 
- After $24999 or higher goal amount the total projects are lower and the percentage of campaigns that failed to reach their goal increases. 
- Also that there are zero canceled campaigns in this subcategory. 

This information is demostrated with the line chart below:

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best time for Louise to plan on the Launch Date for her play should be in the months (May to July) were the highest amount of campaigns were successfull since it could be associate to there being more activity in the summer season and less during late fall and winter/holiday seasons. 
2. Additionally, try to avoid the months that seem to have the highest failed and canceled campaigns such as October to January and this can also be associated to months where there can be more adverse weather conditions. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. A mentioned above in my [Analysis of Outcome Base on Goals](#Analysis-of-Outcomes-Based-on-Goals), there are higher number of total projects (play campaigns) with a lower goal amount and also higher percentage of campaigns being successful and after $24999 or higher goal amount the total projects are lower and the percentage of campaigns that failed to reach their goal increases. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I believe there could of been more details to help define a more prescise outcome such as reviewing campaigns in the same region to get best outcomes. Also not knowing the budget that Louise had in mind for her play to determine specifically what data we can focus more on. Therefore, I feel we could of found a more 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. A good detail we could of looked into was how long the plays that were succesful took to reach their goals.
